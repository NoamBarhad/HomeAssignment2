# Noam portfolio

## Description
Noam portfolio is a collection of projects showcasing my skills and experiences in web development. It is built using HTML and CSS and is suitable for viewing on smartphones.

## Features
- Responsive design
- Clean and modern layout
- Easy navigation

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## New CSS Properties Learned
- `:before` and `:after`: These pseudo-elements allow for the insertion of content before or after an element's content, which can be used for decorative elements or additional styling.
- `clear`: This property specifies where elements should be moved to clear past floating elements.
- `rotate`: This property allows for the rotation of elements, which can be useful for creating visually dynamic designs.

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding CSS positioning: Initially, I struggled with understanding the different CSS positioning properties and how they affect the layout of elements on the page. Through practice and experimentation, I was able to grasp these concepts better.
- Creating a navigation bar: Implementing a navigation bar that is both functional and visually appealing was a challenge. I had to learn about CSS flexbox and CSS grid to create a responsive and well-structured navigation bar.

## Usage
To view the website portfolio, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
